# pandas_notes
This repository contains my takeaways from pandas documentation, and other online resources, which provides for a quick review material for getting started with pandas after a break.
# pandas version : 0.24.1 
Will try to document chronologically, if there is any update with the documentation of the version referred.
# Doubts folder
The doubts folder contains the snippets, I've got issues with, and will be updated the solution/ material that aired away the cloud of doubts. These do come handy at the time of review
### A word with contributors
Contributions are welcomed. The spirit is to create a middleground material between very exhaustive documentation, and quick tutorials, that can help cover most of the material that needs to be reviewed every time you start working on pandas after a temporal break.
